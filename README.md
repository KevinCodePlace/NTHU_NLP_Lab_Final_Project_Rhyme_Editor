Let's try!

It is a Streamlit app to edit the paragraph in a rhyme way.

Firstly, you can can select example paragraph from the drop-down menu or type your own paragraph in the textbox.

Secondly, the application will tell you every last words of each sentence in the paragraph. Now, you can choose one of the words as the target rhyme.

When the checkbox is selected, the application will start to find the synonyms and check the one with the closer rhyme with the target rhyme.

Finally, you can see the result. Each last word is colored. Left hand side is the resived word, and right hand side is the orginal word.

As the result shown above, the target rhyme we choose here is "set-up". The last words in the second and third sentences are both person. Since we consider the context, the person in the second sentence changes to gift, while the person in the third sentence becomes athlete. At the same time, both of them are changed to the rhyme closer to our target word: set-up

Lastly, we further introduce text to speech techique, so you can hear the revised paragraph to get more familiar with the rhyme-revised paragraph.
